**Sensor Data API & Client**

This project consists of two components: a Spring REST API to collect sensor data (temperature, rain status) and a Java client that sends simulated sensor readings to the API.

Features

	•	API: Accepts sensor data and stores it in a database.
	•	Client: Sends POST requests with random temperature and rain data.

Setup

	1.	Clone the repository.
	2.	Run the Spring API (/sensor-data-api folder).
	3.	Use the Java client (/sensor-client folder) to generate sensor data.
